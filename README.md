# WolframLang Differential Equations Scripts

These are scripts that I used to verify my work while taking classes in
Differential Equations, Electrical Engineering, and Signal Processing.

These scripts exist solely to increase my precision and accuracy in solving
these equations.

Calculations in solving such equations can get long and complex, but any
missing details or erroneous minutiae like a missing minus sign or not writing
a number correctly on paper.

Misinterpretation of mathematical concepts or the occassional omission of an
equation that I mentally calculate or entertain also happen frequently enough
to justify writing scripts.
